            <h2>Obtaining bassinet seats</h2>
            <br> <br>
            <br>
            <p>If you have requested or are planning on requesting a bassinet seat for your infant, here are a few notes that you should take into consideration.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Although bassinets are confirmed at the time of reservation, the decision on providing the bassinet on board shall be made by the operating cabin crew, taking into consideration the laid down safety requirements.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Bassinets are awarded for an infant in the case when the infant in question fulfills the following requirements.</p>
            <br>
            <ul type=square class="order">
                <li>The infant should not be able to sit up unassisted</li>
                <li>The maximum weight shall not exceed 16kg</li>
                <li>An approved car seat is required to secure the infant</li>
                <li>Infant should be able to fit in to the bassinet. The legs should not be extending out of the bassinet</li>
                <li>When in use, the Infant shall be restrained using the bassinet restraints</li>
                <li>The bassinet shall not be fixed during taxi, take-off and landing. The infant shall be removed from the bassinet and restrained using a Kangaroo belt or an approved car seat whenever the seat belt sign is illuminated</li>
                <li>Please note that if an infant (under 2 years of age) becomes of an age to be considered a child (2-11 years of age) after first travel date, you are required to pay the additional charges and re-issue the ticket through our Global Call Center or at your nearest ticket office in order to resume the return travel.</li>
